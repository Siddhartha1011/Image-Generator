# Image-Generator
This Python script creates a GUI-based image generation tool using Tkinter and CustomTkinter. The application, named Stable Bud, allows users to input text prompts, which are then used to generate AI-generated images via a Stable Diffusion model from the Hugging Face Diffusers library.
